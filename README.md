![banner-4 1@1x](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6843656/214646426-db3bf292-afc4-4729-8e16-64ed687127aa.png)

Some Twitter links stopped expanding inside Telegram which made it extremely annoying when you wanted to send a banger tweet to your homies in the group chat. This bot replies with an alternative [fxtwitter.com](https://fxtwitter.com) URL which has a working embed for multiple photos and even includes inline video.

## ‚ú®üÜï‚ú® Bot now works in Telegram Channels!

When you add this bot to your channel it will automatically edit any message that includes a Twitter, Instagram, or TikTok link and replace the link in that message with a link to [fxtwitter.com](https://fxtwitter.com), [ddinstagram.com](https://ddinstagram.com), or [vxtiktok.com](https://vxtiktok.com) which have working embeds for each platform. Your channel subscribers will finally be able to watch inline videos and photos without leaving Telegram.

## Also supports Posts.cv!

The bot will expand posts.cv links inside Telegram. It will reply with a link to [postscv.com](https://postscv.com) which has a working embed for posts.cv posts so you can see them play inline inside Telegram.

## Also supports TikTok!

The bot can now expand TikTok videos inside Telegram. It will reply with a link to [vxtiktok.com](https://vxtiktok.com) which has a working embed for TikTok videos so you can see them play inline inside Telegram.

## Also supports Instagram!

You can now expand Instagram links inside Telegram with this bot. It will reply with a link to [ddinstagram.com](https://ddinstagram.com) which has a working embed for multiple photos and even includes inline video. Works with regular Instagram Posts and Reels. Doesn‚Äôt work with Stories or Highlights yet.

While it is technically possible through the Bot API, I simply do not have the time or desire to snoop on your shit. The only thing I will keep track of is counting anonymous events when buttons are clicked, bot commands are used, a tweet has multiple images (etc.) to monitor stats to see if people are finding this bot useful.
