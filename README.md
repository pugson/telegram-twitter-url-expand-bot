# Link Expander ‚Äî Telegram Bot for expanding Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube Shorts, Spotify, Reddit, Threads, Bluesky, Hacker News, and Dribbble links.

Some Twitter links stopped expanding inside Telegram which made it extremely annoying when you wanted to send a banger tweet to your homies in the group chat. This bot replies with an alternative [fxtwitter.com](https://fxtwitter.com) URL which has a working embed for multiple photos and even includes inline video.

## ‚ú®üÜï‚ú® Support for Spotify links!

It will also send a sample audio clip in another message.

## Do you read all messages inside the chat?

üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è **No, I will never do that.** üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

While it is technically possible through the Bot API, I simply do not have the time or desire to snoop on your shit. The only thing I will keep track of is counting anonymous events when buttons are clicked, bot commands are used, a tweet has multiple images (etc.) to monitor stats to see if people are finding this bot useful.

You can check the code and verify that none of the messages are being stored or logged in any way.
