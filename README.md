Some Twitter links stopped expanding inside Telegram which made it extremely annoying when you wanted to send a banger tweet to your homies in the group chat. This bot replies with an alternative [vxtwitter.com](https://vxtwitter.com) URL which has a working embed for multiple photos and even includes inline video.

## ‚ú®üÜï‚ú® Also supports Instagram links!

You can now expand Instagram links inside Telegram with this bot. It will reply with a link to [ddinstagram.com](https://ddinstagram.com) which has a working embed for multiple photos and even includes inline video. Works with regular Instagram Posts and Reels. Doesn‚Äôt work with Stories or Highlights yet.

> **Note**
>
> There is no message logging or personal tracking ‚Äî your chats stay private.
>
> The exact source code that‚Äôs published on GitHub is automatically [deployed to Railway](https://railway.app?referralCode=dev) and logs will never include any user/chat/personal info or content. You can audit the code to see for yourself.

## Do you read all messages inside the chat?

While it is technically possible through the Bot API, I simply do not have the time or desire to snoop on your shit. The only thing I keep track of is counting anonymous events when buttons are clicked or if a tweet has multiple images, to see if people are finding this bot helpful.
