Some Twitter links stopped expanding inside Telegram which made it extremely annoying when you wanted to send some banger tweet to your homies in the group chat. This bot replies with an alternative [vxtwitter.com](https://vxtwitter.com) URL which has a working embed for multiple photos and even includes inline video.

## Do you read all messages inside the chat?

While it is technically possible through the Bot API, I simply do not have the time or desire to snoop on your shit. The only thing I keep track of is counting anonymous events when a "Yes" or "No" button is clicked to see if people are finding this bot helpful.
